12:52:05 AM: DevgRu: Please no.

12:53:03 AM: Turtle: the afk training would be solved if you had stricter punishment
12:53:03 AM: mYstic: PB, it wouldn't do much at all for afk leveling, there is auto click programs, and most monsters attack on site
12:53:06 AM: Zaber: comin nypes lol
12:53:12 AM: Nypes: phew

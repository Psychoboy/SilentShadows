ServerStatus ALPHA 1.0
======================

I guess that if you don't know how to implent this
into your own project, you're reading this file.

I'm good at guessing, aren't I?
Anyhow... you'll be wanting to know how to install this,
so just follow the four steps below and it should work.

1, Open your Server project and import frmStatus.frm.
2, View code for modGeneral, find Sub InitServer()
3, Find		Call SetStatus("Spawning map npcs...")
		Call SpawnAllMapNpcs
4, Right below that, insert the following code:
		Call SetStatus("Starting ServerStatus...")
		Load frmStatus
		DoEvents

==========
Well I guess that's that, and lets leave it at that.
It should work, it's not done yet, it's sloppy.

When you start your server next time, it should listen on one
port number above the game port (GAME_PORT + 1)

So now, all you have to do is visit http://ip:port/
(replacing ip with YOUR ip, and port with the serverstatus port)

That's all, my first so called "tutorial".
